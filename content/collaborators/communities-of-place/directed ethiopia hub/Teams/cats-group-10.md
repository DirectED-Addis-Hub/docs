# CATS Group 10

## Problem Title
AfriChainAid

## Overview
CATS Group 10 is working on AfriChainAid, a way to improve how humanitarian assistance is coordinated and tracked. In many African crises, aid distribution can be slow, opaque, and difficult to verify on the ground.

## Who Experiences This Problem
- Internally displaced people and vulnerable communities  
- NGOs and humanitarian organizations  
- Local coordinators and volunteers  
- Donors who want to see where funds and goods go  

## Why This Matters
When aid is delayed, misallocated, or poorly tracked, the most vulnerable suffer. Transparent, tamper-resistant tracking and coordination tools can help ensure timely and fair distribution of support.
