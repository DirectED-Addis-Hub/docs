# EnkuBlock

## Problem Title
DrugLog

## Overview
EnkuBlock is working on DrugLog, a system to improve how medicines are tracked from importers and warehouses to hospitals, pharmacies, and ultimately patients. Current processes can be opaque, paper-based, and hard to audit.

## Who Experiences This Problem
- Hospitals and clinics that must manage inventory and safety  
- Pharmacies dispensing medicines with limited upstream visibility  
- Regulators overseeing quality, expiry, and distribution  
- Patients relying on safe, authentic medication  

## Why This Matters
Weak visibility across the medicine supply chain can lead to stock-outs, expired drugs, diversion, or misuse. Better tracking and auditability can protect patients, reduce waste, and support regulatory oversight.
