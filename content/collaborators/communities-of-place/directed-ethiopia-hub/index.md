# DirectED Ethiopia Hub

The DirectED Ethiopia Hub is a community-of-place within the DirectEd ecosystem. It brings together 59 builders, innovators, and learners across Ethiopia. The hub is home to 10 active teams exploring challenges across healthcare, agriculture, identity, economic coordination, artisan empowerment, and humanitarian logistics.

We operate through structured collaboration, weekly learning rhythms, transparent documentation, and peer-led exploration. Our work aligns with DirectEd’s principles of decentralization, autonomy, and shared learning.



## Hub Purpose

The DirectED Ethiopia Hub exists to:

- Support teams working on real problems grounded in Ethiopian contexts.  
- Create an environment for discovery, experimentation, and responsible innovation.  
- Document local insights for global learning across the DirectEd network.  
- Strengthen Ethiopia’s developer and builder ecosystem through collaboration and mentorship.  
- Explore decentralized tools that improve lives, trust, and transparency.
