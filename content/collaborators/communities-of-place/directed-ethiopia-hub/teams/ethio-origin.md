# Ethio-Origin

## Problem Title
Farm-to-Market Traceability (Coffee/Tea/Flowers)

## Overview
Ethio-Origin is focused on traceability in agricultural value chains such as coffee, tea, and flowers. Today, information about origin, handling, and quality is fragmented or opaque, which weakens trust and bargaining power for producers and buyers.

## Who Experiences This Problem
- Smallholder farmers who cannot prove quality or origin  
- Transporters and exporters managing complex logistics  
- Retailers who need reliable sourcing information  
- Local and international buyers who want proof of authenticity  

## Why This Matters
Without transparent traceability, high-value Ethiopian products can be undervalued, mislabelled, or lost in complex chains. Better traceability can improve farmer income, reward good practices, and give buyers confidence in what they are purchasing.
