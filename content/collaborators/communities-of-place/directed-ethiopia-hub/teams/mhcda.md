# MHCDA

## Problem Title
Equb

## Overview
MHCDA focuses on strengthening traditional rotating savings groups such as Equb. These community savings systems move significant money but often rely on informal records and trust, which can be fragile.

## Who Experiences This Problem
- Equb members contributing regularly  
- Group leaders managing contributions and payouts  
- Communities relying on Equb for emergencies, projects, or capital  

## Why This Matters
When records are unclear or disputes arise, trust can collapse and savings can be lost. Bringing more transparency, simple digital records, and fair oversight can protect members while respecting the cultural roots of Equb.
