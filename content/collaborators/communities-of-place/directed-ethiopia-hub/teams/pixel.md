## Problem Title
Saba

## Overview
Pixel is working on Saba, a project that supports African women artisans who struggle to reach global markets. Many create high-quality handmade products but lack digital presence, tools, or trusted channels to showcase and sell their work.

## Who Experiences This Problem
- Women artisans with limited market access  
- Small creative collectives without digital tools  
- Buyers who want authentic, ethical African products  

## Why This Matters
Without visibility and fair access to buyers, artisans are underpaid and their craft is undervalued. A better way to present, verify, and transact around their work can increase income, recognition, and long-term sustainability.
