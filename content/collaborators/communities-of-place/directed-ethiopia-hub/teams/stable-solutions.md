# Stable Solutions

## Problem Title
Decentralized Prescription Authentication & Misuse Prevention on Cardano

## Overview
Stable Solutions is tackling prescription fraud and medication misuse in healthcare systems where pharmacies often rely on trust or manual checks. This creates space for fake prescriptions, unsafe drug use, and heavy administrative burden for already stretched staff.

## Who Experiences This Problem
- Patients who need verified, legitimate prescriptions  
- Doctors who want confidence their prescriptions are filled correctly  
- Pharmacies that must quickly verify authenticity  
- Health authorities seeking traceability and oversight  

## Why This Matters
Prescription fraud directly harms patients, wastes scarce resources, and undermines trust in healthcare systems. A verifiable, tamper-resistant way to issue and validate prescriptions could reduce misuse and improve safety while fitting real clinical workflows.
