## Problem Title
Fragmented Medical Records Across Healthcare Facilities

## Overview
Team Axiom is addressing the fragmentation of medical records across hospitals and clinics. When patients move between facilities, their history, lab results, and medications often do not follow them, forcing repeated tests and incomplete care.

## Who Experiences This Problem
- Patients who receive disjointed, repetitive, or unsafe care  
- Doctors and nurses working without full medical histories  
- Hospitals duplicating tests and paperwork  
- Families who pay repeatedly for the same investigations  

## Why This Matters
Fragmented records increase costs, delay treatment, and introduce serious safety risks. A more connected, privacy-aware way to share essential medical information can improve outcomes and reduce waste.
