# CATS G-3

## Problem Title
LoyalCoin: Unified Multi-Merchant Loyalty Currency on Cardano

## Overview
CATS G-3 is working on LoyalCoin, a unified loyalty currency that multiple merchants can use. Today, customers carry many isolated loyalty cards or apps, and SMEs run siloed programs that are hard to maintain and do not interoperate.

## Who Experiences This Problem
- Customers juggling multiple loyalty schemes  
- Small and medium merchants trying to retain customers  
- Local ecosystems where spending could be better rewarded  

## Why This Matters
Fragmented loyalty systems limit collaboration between businesses and reduce the value customers receive. A shared, interoperable loyalty system can strengthen local economies and create better incentives across merchants.
