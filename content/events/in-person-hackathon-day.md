# 🏛️ In-Person Hackathon Day

The **CATS26 Pre-Summit Hackathon** is a one-day, in-person working session where teams come together to make real progress on their ideas.

This day is about collaboration, focus, and momentum. You’ll spend the day working alongside your team, exploring a real problem, shaping a solution, and building an early version of your idea that you can continue refining after the event.

> This is a chance to move your project forward in a shared space with support.

## 🎯 What This Day Is For

The in-person hackathon exists to help teams get aligned and unstuck.

During the day, teams will:

- Clarify the problem they are working on
- Agree on a practical solution direction
- Start building an early prototype or clear concept
- Get feedback from mentors and facilitators
- Leave with something tangible and documented

By the end of the day, you should be able to clearly explain what you’re building, why it matters, and what your next steps are.

- Show real progress, even if it’s rough
- Document what you build or decide (links, screenshots, notes)

- Be respectful to other teams, mentors, and the venue
- Stay engaged and work with your team throughout the day
- Be honest about what you’ve built or explored

This is a shared space focused on learning and collaboration.
