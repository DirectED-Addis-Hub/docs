# Events

The Addis Ababa Hub events provide the shared rhythm that keeps teams aligned, accountable, and moving forward throughout the hackathon.

Events are designed to support teams at different stages of their journey — from early exploration and problem framing, through technical building and integration, to final demos and submission readiness.

This page gives an overview of how events are structured and how teams are expected to participate.

## Event Structure

Hub events are organised around two complementary formats:

- **Virtual sessions** for continuity, coordination, and learning  
- **In-person sessions** for deeper collaboration, workshops, and milestone moments  

Together, they create a steady cadence that balances flexibility with accountability.

## Virtual Events

Virtual events form the backbone of the hub’s weekly rhythm.

These sessions typically include:

- Team check-ins and progress updates  
- Review of blockers and technical challenges  
- Guidance on methodology, documentation, and expectations  
- Mentorship touchpoints and Q&A  

Virtual sessions ensure that all teams remain aligned with timelines, submission requirements, and learning goals, even when working asynchronously.

## In-Person Events

In-person events are milestone moments within the hub.

They are used for:

- Workshops and guided learning sessions  
- Collaborative problem-framing and design activities  
- Technical deep dives and integration support  
- Demos, reviews, and final presentations  

These sessions create space for deeper focus, peer learning, and shared momentum across the Addis Ababa Hub.

## Participation Expectations

All teams are expected to:

- Attend scheduled hub events or notify the hub team in advance  
- Come prepared with updates, questions, or materials relevant to the session  
- Document outcomes, decisions, and next steps after each event  
- Use events as checkpoints for real progress, not passive attendance  

Events are not optional add-ons — they are a core part of how teams move from exploration to submission.
