# 🎮 Kahoots

Kahoots are a weekly part of the hackathon experience. Each week, we run a live Kahoot session based entirely on the workshop content covered during that same week. The goal is simple: help you review key ideas, reinforce what you’ve learned, and stay engaged with the program in a fun, low-pressure way.

If you attended the workshop or reviewed the shared materials, you will be well prepared. Kahoots are not designed to trick you; they reflect exactly what has already been taught.

## 📋 How Kahoots Work

Kahoot sessions are held once per week and are played live during a scheduled session (check your calendar, and we also post announcements inside the channel). You will receive the joining link and instructions during the session itself. All questions are directly drawn from that week’s workshop content, including concepts discussed, examples shown, and key takeaways.

Participation is open to all hackathon participants. To be eligible for prizes, you must be present during the live session.

**Step-by-step instructions**

1. Join the hub call at the scheduled time.
2. When the host shares the **Game PIN**, open Kahoot:
    - Go to the Kahoot join page (or open the app)
    - Enter the PIN
3. Stay until the end, final questions often decide the leaderboard.

## **🎁**  Prizes

Each weekly Kahoot comes with cash prizes for the top performers. At the end of every session, the top three participants are awarded as follows:

- **1st place:** $15
- **2nd place:** $10
- **3rd place:** $5

Prizes are awarded weekly, and every Kahoot is a fresh opportunity to win.

## 👑 The Leaderboard

The leaderboard showcases the **winners of each week’s Kahoot**.

After every Kahoot session, the top three participants of that week are featured on the leaderboard. Their names and photos are added to the **Wall of Winners** as a public recognition of their performance based on that week’s content.

Each week stands on its own. Even if you didn’t place in a previous Kahoot, you can still appear on the leaderboard by performing well in the next one.

## Past Kahoots and Recordings

If you are unable to attend a live Kahoot session, recordings will be made available here. These recordings allow you to review the questions, see the correct answers, and reinforce your understanding of the workshop material.

While watching recordings is useful for learning, only participants who join the live session are eligible for prizes.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

To keep things fair and smooth for everyone:

- You must join the Kahoot live to qualify for prizes
- Please use an appropriate and identifiable username
- In the case of a tie, Kahoot’s built-in scoring rules are used

Kahoots are one of the easiest ways to stay sharp, test your understanding, and get rewarded for showing up and paying attention. Make it a habit to join each week.
