# About the Addis Ababa Hub

## Purpose

The Addis Ababa Hub exists to create a grounded, supportive environment where innovators can explore their place, engage with community realities, and work on problems rooted in local context.

The aim is to help teams surface what matters in their city and translate that understanding into meaningful, regenerative technological projects.

## Vision

To grow a resilient innovation community in Addis Ababa—one that listens carefully to local needs, values community voices, and enables young builders to design solutions that strengthen social, economic, and institutional systems.

## Mission

To guide teams through a structured but human process that combines:

- Community exploration  
- Technical and design skill-building  
- Collaboration and peer learning  
- Prototype development and clear documentation  

The mission is simple: ensure every team in Addis Ababa has the clarity, support, and mentorship needed to deliver work grounded in real community insight.
