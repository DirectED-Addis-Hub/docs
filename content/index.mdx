# DirectED Ethiopia Hub

## Hacking learning, not just the code!

The DirectED Ethiopia Hub is a community-of-place within the DirectEd ecosystem.  
We bring together **59 builders across 10 teams** working on grounded challenges in:

- healthcare  
- agriculture  
- identity & records  
- economic coordination  
- artisan empowerment  
- humanitarian logistics  

We help teams move from **field research → insight → MVPs → publishable submissions** for DirectEd, Prisma, WADA, and aligned partners.
