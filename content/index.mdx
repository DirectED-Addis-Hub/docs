# DirectED Ethiopia Hub

The DirectED Ethiopia Hub is a community-of-place within the DirectEd ecosystem. It brings together 59 builders, innovators, and learners across Ethiopia. The hub is home to 10 active teams exploring challenges across healthcare, agriculture, identity, economic coordination, artisan empowerment, and humanitarian logistics.

We operate through structured collaboration, weekly learning rhythms, transparent documentation, and peer-led exploration. Our work aligns with DirectEd’s principles of decentralization, autonomy, and shared learning.

## Hub Purpose

The DirectED Ethiopia Hub exists to:

- Support teams working on real problems grounded in Ethiopian contexts.
- Create an environment for discovery, experimentation, and responsible innovation.
- Document local insights for global learning across the DirectEd network.
- Strengthen Ethiopia’s developer and builder ecosystem through collaboration and mentorship.
- Explore decentralized tools that improve lives, trust, and transparency.

## Ethiopia Hub Teams

The hub currently includes 10 teams:

- [Stable Solutions](/collaborators/communities-of-place/directed-ethiopia-hub/teams/stable-solutions.md)
- [Ethio-Origin](/collaborators/communities-of-place/directed-ethiopia-hub/teams/ethio-origin.md)
- [Team Axiom](/collaborators/communities-of-place/directed-ethiopia-hub/teams/team-axiom.md)
- [Pixel](/collaborators/communities-of-place/directed-ethiopia-hub/teams/pixel.md)

The DirectED Ethiopia Hub is a distributed [action-learning](/patterns/action-learning.md) community within the DirectEd ecosystem. We organise and facilitate action-learning journeys, <FeatureText text="ALJ" className="text-lg cursor-pointer" href="/patterns/action-learning%20journeys" />s, so that student teams and local communities in Ethiopia can participate more fully in transition pathways toward life-affirming futures. We work at three levels of incubation:

<Steps>
  ### Case
  Each team participates in an action-learning journey that generates a [place](/glossary/Place.md)-sourced, time-bound expression of system change, documented as a case study. DirectED Ethiopia Hub <FeatureText text="CASE" className="text-lg cursor-pointer" href="/patterns/case-study" colorSelections={[4,5]} /> makes visible the real-world application of practice in Ethiopian contexts, with clear problem statements, experiments, and learning.

  ### Form
  We incubate self-organising action-learning teams by supporting their transition into digitally coordinated, accountable entities rooted in real-world alignment. These practice-oriented teams develop agreements, governance protocols, and lightweight “practice-DAO” structures that can interface with DirectEd, partners, and funders.

  ### Pathways
  Our ecosystem connects the Ethiopia Hub, other DirectEd hubs, partner institutions, mentors, and aligned funders. At this level, we steward long-term pathways for students and projects—linking technical skills, local impact, and regenerative economic opportunities—so each ecosystem becomes a learning system capable of evolving its own enabling environment.
