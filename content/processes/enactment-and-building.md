# Enactment & Building

### Purpose

To move from intention to visible action.

This process centers on making progress real through working artifacts rather than speculative plans.

### What Happens

Teams:

* Build MVPs incrementally
* Test ideas through implementation
* Integrate feedback through rapid iteration

Progress is validated through *what exists*, not what is promised.

### Implementation Approach

* Live or recorded demos during review sessions
* Technical walkthroughs and targeted support
* Weekly Kahoot sessions (Fridays) to reinforce learning, energy, and shared momentum

### Outcomes

Teams produce:

* Verifiable working components
* Documented progress suitable for evaluation
* A solution trajectory grounded in reality

---

*This process is supported by demo recordings, code repositories, and review documentation.*
