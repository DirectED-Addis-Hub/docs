# Grounding & Alignment

### Purpose

To translate understanding into shared direction.

This process anchors teams in intent, scope, and feasibility before significant technical effort is applied.

### What Happens

Teams:

* Refine and stress-test problem statements
* Surface assumptions and constraints
* Align internally on roles, priorities, and decision-making

The goal is **directional coherence**, not polish.

### Implementation Approach

* Weekly team check-ins to validate direction and surface blockers
* Facilitated workshops (Tuesdays and Thursdays) to deepen alignment
* Ongoing Q&A sessions to prevent drift

### Outcomes

Teams demonstrate:

* A stable, defensible problem framing
* Clear articulation of intended impact
* Readiness to build with purpose

---

*This process is evidenced through check-in notes, workshop recordings, and alignment artifacts.*
