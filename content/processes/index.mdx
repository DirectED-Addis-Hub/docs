# Regenerative Process Overview

DirectED operates through a set of interconnected regenerative processes that guide teams from early sensemaking to delivery and continuity.

The framework is designed to be:

* **Evaluator‑legible**: progress, intent, and execution are clear and verifiable
* **Participant‑actionable**: teams always know what phase they are in and what is expected next
* **Operationally grounded**: cadence, reviews, and documentation are embedded into the flow

While aligned with the CATS regenerative methodology, the processes are expressed through DirectED’s own execution model and language.

## The Process Flow

The journey unfolds through four mutually reinforcing processes:

1. **Orientation & Sensemaking**
   Establishes shared understanding of the problem space, context, and evaluation criteria.

2. **Grounding & Alignment**
   Translates understanding into coherent direction, internal alignment, and feasible scope.

3. **Enactment & Building**
   Moves teams from intention to action through iterative building and visible progress.

4. **Reflection & Continuity**
   Consolidates learning, documents outcomes, and prepares work for continuation beyond the program.

These processes are not treated as rigid stages, but as a regenerative loop—each informing and strengthening the next.

## How the Processes Are Run

Across all processes, DirectED maintains a consistent operational rhythm:

* **Weekly team check‑ins** to validate progress and surface blockers
* **Workshops twice a week (Tuesdays & Thursdays)** to deepen understanding and technical alignment
* **Open Q&A sessions (Mondays)** to resolve uncertainty early
* **Kahoot sessions (Fridays)** to reinforce learning, engagement, and shared momentum

This cadence ensures that learning, building, and reflection happen continuously, not only at milestones.

## Evidence & Accountability

Evidence is produced naturally as part of the process rather than as a separate reporting layer.

Across the framework, this includes:

* Recorded workshops and Q&A sessions
* Live or recorded demos during reviews
* Published documentation and repositories

Artifacts are surfaced contextually within supporting pages and linked where relevant.

## Closing Note

This process framework reflects DirectED’s approach to regenerative practice: **clarity before speed, execution over intention, and continuity beyond delivery**. It is intentionally adaptable across hubs and cohorts while remaining methodologically rigorous.
