# Orientation & Sensemaking

### Purpose

To situate teams within the problem space, ecosystem context, and methodological expectations before solution-building begins.

This process ensures teams are not building prematurely, but are responding to a clearly understood reality.

### What Happens

Teams are introduced to:

* The challenge landscape and local context
* Regenerative thinking as a design lens
* What meaningful progress looks like from an evaluation standpoint

The emphasis is on **clarity before speed**.

### Implementation Approach

* Structured onboarding sessions
* Guided walkthroughs of methodology and expectations
* Weekly Q&A sessions to resolve early uncertainty

### Outcomes

Teams leave this process with:

* A grounded understanding of the problem they are addressing
* Clear framing of who the work is for and why it matters
* Alignment on how progress will be assessed

---

*This process is supported by onboarding recordings, introductory workshops, and documented guidance.*
