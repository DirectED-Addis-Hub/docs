# Reflection & Continuity

### Purpose

To consolidate learning, assess outcomes, and ensure work can continue beyond the immediate program.

Delivery is treated not as an endpoint, but as a handoff.

### What Happens

Teams:

* Reflect on what worked and what did not
* Document decisions, learnings, and limitations
* Prepare materials for external review and future iteration

### Implementation Approach

* Final reviews focused on substance over presentation
* Structured documentation for the public-facing docs app
* Guidance on continuation paths beyond the program

### Outcomes

Teams leave with:

* A coherent narrative of their journey
* Clear evidence of execution
* Assets that can be built upon after the program

---

*This process is evidenced through final submissions, documentation pages, and recorded reviews.*
