## Purpose of Stage 1

Before designing or coding, your mission is to **understand your place** in the real environment, people, systems, and stories from which your solution will emerge. Your project must be rooted in lived reality rather than assumptions. In this stage, you will **explore, listen, observe, and make sense** of what is actually happening in your community. Your outputs from this stage will become the **foundation of your final project**.

## 1. 📋Required Outcomes (What You Must Produce)

Every team must submit **all four outcomes** listed below.

### 1.1 Outcome 1: Community Essence Map

A clear representation of what you discovered during exploration.

Must include:

- Key stories or quotes from people you met

- Patterns, tensions, or themes you identified
- A simple timeline or narrative showing how life unfolds in your place

**Format options:**

- 1–2 page written narrative
- A diagram or timeline + short explanation
- PDF, doc, or image

### 1.2 Outcome 2: Stakeholder Map

- Stakeholders (institutions, organizations, local actors)
- Emerging leaders (youth, innovators, informal influencers)
- Groups affected by the challenge you discovered

**Format options:**

- Diagram
- Table
- Flow map
- PDF, doc, or image

### 1.3 Outcome 3: Draft Challenge / Problem Statement

A clear, concise statement rooted in what you actually observed.

Must answer:

- What is happening in your place?

- How might technology play a meaningful, supportive role?

**Format:**

## 2. 🪜 Step-by-Step Instructions ( How to do this practically)

> Follow these steps in order. Do not skip ahead or jump into solution mode.

### 2.1 Step 1: Set Your Intention as a Team

As a group, discuss:

1. Why are you participating?
2. What do you hope to learn?
3. What does “serving the community” mean to you?

Agree on:

- How will you listen to each other
- How will you share responsibilities
- How will you document your findings

This sets the foundation for all your work.

### 2.2 Step 2: Explore Your Community

Go outside. Walk your place. Look closely at what is happening around you.

**Observe:**

- Where is energy or activity gathering?
- What feels neglected or stressed?
- What patterns repeat?

**Listen:**

Speak to **at least 3–5 people**, such as:

- Local shop owners
- Elders
- Students or youth
- Community workers
- Anyone with lived experience

**Ask simple, open questions:**

- “What is important to pay attention to right now?”
- “What is working well here?”
- “What challenges do people face?”
- “What opportunities do you wish existed?”

**Document everything:**

- Notes
- Quotes
- Photos
- Short audio (optional)
- Sketches

This raw material is essential for your outputs.

### 2.3 Step 3: Make Sense of What You Found

Come together as a team and put all your observations in one place.

You must identify:

- Common themes or patterns
- Surprising insights
- Tensions or gaps
- Strengths or bright spots
- Systems and people involved

You may use:

- Whiteboards
- Notion
- Paper
- Miro
- Simple diagrams

This synthesis becomes the backbone of your maps and challenge statement.

### 2.4 Step 4: Create Your Required Outputs

Using everything you discovered, produce the four required outcomes.

**✔ Convert your stories and observations into**

- A **Community Essence Map**
- A **Stakeholder Map**

**✔ Turn your shared insights into**

- A **Draft Challenge Statement**

**✔ Capture how your understanding changed through**

- A **Team Reflection Summary**

Each outcome must be uploaded clearly and named properly.
