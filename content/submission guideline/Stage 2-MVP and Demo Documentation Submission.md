## 🧭 Overview

<aside> 💡

This guide explains exactly what your team needs to submit for the next stage of documentation, why these materials matter, and the **non-negotiable deadline** for submitting them. These items allow Hub Leads to complete the second half of your team’s documentation so evaluators can access your pitch, your build, and your technical progress.

Before you start building, please go through this recorded workshop-[How to Quickly Build an MVP](https://us06web.zoom.us/rec/play/rVn7ZnRW857AtXR9cmJ8jT-JMe5u-g1OlrVduUvU4rN3YJ0xNx9vRu-Z-fUJDcKnrmHA5iecE0JuaW8.rKwubhxsIMMqrjuX?accessLevel=meeting&canPlayFromShare=true&from=my_recording&continueMode=true&componentName=rec-play&originRequestUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fus06web.zoom.us%2Frec%2Fshare%2FokSuW1ILNCLvRig1G2abFOp-bFWL0xCs4IulDUtAMs-8pJpQF8Svjy3EP02GE35s.GlI8p8rNjjKBSJ4m%3FstartTime%3D1742913415000%2520Passcode%3A%2520Nk1%25SF4J) with Yash Goyal, 15x time web3 hackathon winner.

## ☑️ What Your Team Must Submit

Your team is required to submit **four items** that give evaluators a complete view of your work so far.

### 1. Pitch Recording

Record a clear explanation of your team’s purpose and the problem you are responding to. This is your chance to articulate the intention behind your build.

### 2. Live Demo Recording

Show your current prototype or MVP in action. Walk through what is working right now, even if it is early-stage. Demonstrating real functionality helps evaluators understand your progress.

> You can use loom to record this

### 3. Deployment Link

Provide a working link where your project is hosted. Evaluators and Hub Leads will rely on this link to open and interact with your build directly.

### 4. GitHub Repository Link

Submit a **public link** to your repo containing your codebase. This allows evaluators to examine the structure of your project and see how it is being developed.

These four components together represent your team's current state of progress.

## 📅 Deadline and form (Non-Negotiable)

<aside> ⚠️

### **Saturday, December 13**

This is the **final and non-negotiable deadline** for all teams.

Hub Leads must have enough time to prepare their documentation pages. Because of this, **late submissions cannot be accepted**.

**Your team will submit the four required items using the embedded Tally form below** 👇

## 📋 How to Submit Correctly

To ensure your documentation is processed smoothly, follow these steps:

### Submit only once per team

- Select **one team member** to complete the submission.
- Prepare all four items **before** opening the form.
- Check that every link works and is accessible.

### Avoid duplicate submissions

If your team has already submitted this package, and your name is included, **you do not need to submit again**.

### After submitting

Share the confirmation internally so the whole team knows the submission is complete.

These steps keep your documentation organised and prevent delays for Hub Leads.

## 📌 What Happens Next

Once your submission is processed:

- Hub Leads will integrate your materials into your team’s documentation.
- Evaluators will access your pitch, demo, deployment, and repo through the platform.
- Your project will be reviewed alongside others during the next evaluation cycle.
- You should move to stage 3 of the submission guide and complete it by December 15th!

Your materials help evaluators understand not just what you intended to build, but how far you’ve progressed.
