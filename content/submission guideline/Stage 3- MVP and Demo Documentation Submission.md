## 🧭 Overview

<aside> 💡

This guide explains exactly what you, as a participant, need to submit, why it matters at this stage of the programme, and the deadlines that apply. Everything here is directly based on the official information provided by WADA and PRISMA.

## ☑️ What You Need to Submit

Two forms are available on the enrolment platform found here 👇

[CATS Registration](https://cats.wada.org/enrolment)

These are:

- **Hubs:** Story Publishing Form
- **Participants:** Team Formation / Team Enrolment Form

As a participant, your responsibility is the **Team Enrolment Form**, which officially registers your team within the programme.

**What the form asks you to provide:**

- The **purpose** that has called your team into action
- Your **self-defined problem statements**
- Confirmation of **which hub you are related to**, if applicable

This is your team’s first formal expression of what you care about and what you are working on.

## 📅 Deadlines

Your submission must follow these exact dates:

<aside> ⚠️

**🗓 December 15 – Final Deadline**

**This is the primary deadline for both team submissions and hub story submissions.**

A short extension is allowed for technical issues, and submissions are accepted until 👇

**🗓 December 19 – Grace Period (Late Submissions Marked Late)**

**However:**

- Submissions received between December 15 and December 19 will be marked **late**.
- The **Team Enrolment Form closes completely on December 19**.
    - **This is a _hard stop_.**
    - **After this date, no team submissions will be accepted.**
- Any hub that has not submitted its first story by December 19 will be considered to have **missed the deadline**. ( Hub stories are published by hub leads)

These boundaries are required to ensure evaluators have adequate time to see how your work develops between now and the evaluation period.

## 🛣️ Why This Submission Matters

Over the past weeks, you have:

- Explored your neighbourhoods
- Observed places, patterns, and issues that matter to you
- Formed teams around shared intention
- Begun translating those insights into early technical directions, whether toward a prototype or an MVP

Your submission captures that beginning. It is the moment where your purpose and problem statement become visible to the programme. Once submitted, your team will be **reflected on the globe**, giving evaluators and the wider programme a clear anchor point for understanding your journey.

## 📋 How to Submit Correctly

To keep the process organised for everyone, follow these instructions:

### Submit only once per team

- Choose a single person to complete the form.
- You may fill it out together as a team, but **submit only one form**.
- Duplicates confuse and should be avoided.

If your team has already submitted, and you are listed in that submission, **you are done;** you do not need to submit anything yourself.

When your team submits:

- Your team will be **reflected on the globe**, the main interface for seeing all teams.
- Evaluators will use this submission as their **first point of reference** to begin understanding your project.

This initial submission helps evaluators see the purpose guiding your team and the problem you are responding to.

## What Happens Next

After your team submits:

- Your team appears on the globe.
- Evaluators begin reviewing your early direction.
- They later select top teams based on how projects evolve.

<aside> 📅

Key dates:

- **January 6**: evaluators choose the top 3 teams from each place
- **January 9**: evaluators choose the top 5 teams across the whole programme

Your submission now is the starting point they return to.
