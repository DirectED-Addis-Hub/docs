# 🧭 Submission Journey Overview

The CATS programme is structured into **three clear submission stages**. Each stage builds on the previous one and represents a different phase of your team’s journey — from understanding your place, to building and documenting progress, to formally enrolling your team in the global programme.

This page helps you understand **what each stage is for**, **when to engage with it**, and **where to go next**.

## 🪜 How the Stages Connect

- **Stage 1** defines *why* your project exists  
- **Stage 2** shows *what* you are building and *how far* you’ve progressed  
- **Stage 3** formally registers *who you are* and *what you stand for*

Each stage is required. Skipping or rushing one weakens the others.

Follow the stages **in order**, respect the deadlines, and document your work clearly.
