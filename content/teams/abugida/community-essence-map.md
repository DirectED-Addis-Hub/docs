# 🧭 Community Essence Map — Abugida

**Location:** Addis Ababa  
**Focus area:** Youth-run micro-enterprises and small local merchants

## Stories from the community

Young shop owners and micro-entrepreneurs described running businesses that survive month to month. Many rely on repeat customers but struggle to attract new ones. Rising costs, rent increases, and sudden economic shocks make growth risky.

Several merchants shared that even loyal customers are not enough to stabilize income. Without access to affordable capital or broader exposure, one slow month can lead to closure.

Many merchants expressed interest in loyalty programs but said existing systems feel expensive, fragmented, or designed for large businesses—not small neighborhood shops.

## Observations (what keeps repeating)

- Businesses depend heavily on a small group of regular customers.
- Customer data is informal or nonexistent.
- Cash-based loyalty is fragmented and not reusable across merchants.
- Access to affordable capital is extremely limited.
- Growth feels risky; survival is the priority.

## Patterns, tensions, and themes

- **Pattern:** Strong community ties, weak growth pathways
- **Pattern:** Loyalty exists but is not captured or shared
- **Tension:** Informality vs. scalability
- **Tension:** Survival mode vs. long-term planning
- **Theme:** Financial fragility of youth-run enterprises
- **Theme:** Missed network effects between small merchants

## A typical business cycle

Daily sales → reliance on regulars → slow periods → cash shortage → inability to invest → stagnation or closure

Growth is constrained not by effort, but by structural limitations.
