# Abugida

## Problem
Youth-run neighborhood businesses often struggle to grow beyond their immediate circle. After initial support fades, they lack affordable ways to attract new customers, collaborate with nearby shops, or access small amounts of capital. Each business operates in isolation, limiting community-wide growth.

## MVP

### Scope
- A shared loyalty system usable across nearby merchants
- Basic community support mechanism through shared incentives

### Cardano Integration
Cardano is used as the backbone for:
- A shared loyalty coin earned and spent across multiple businesses
- Community-backed participation through on-chain tokens
