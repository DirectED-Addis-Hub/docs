# Our Story

## How We Started

We entered this work through small shops and youth-run micro-enterprises in Addis Ababa. These are businesses built with effort, resilience, and strong community ties, yet constantly operating on the edge of survival.

At first, what we saw looked like a growth problem. Shops that struggled to attract new customers. Merchants who worked long hours but saw little progress. But as we listened more closely, it became clear that growth was not the real issue.

The issue was stability.

## What We Heard and Observed

Young shop owners told us that their businesses survive month to month. Many rely on a small group of regular customers. When those customers stop coming, even briefly, income drops immediately.

Rising rent, inflation, and unexpected shocks make planning difficult. Several merchants explained that even loyal customers are not enough to protect them during slow periods. One bad month can undo years of effort.

Many expressed interest in loyalty programs or customer incentives, but existing options felt expensive, fragmented, or designed for large businesses. Nothing fit the reality of a neighborhood shop.

These recurring experiences are documented more fully in our  
[Community Essence Map](./community-essence-map).

## Where the System Breaks

As we mapped the ecosystem, we saw how isolated each merchant is.

Every shop builds its own small customer base.  
Customer data lives in memory, not systems.  
Loyalty exists, but it cannot travel beyond one business.  

Because loyalty is cash-based and informal, it cannot be shared or leveraged. Merchants cannot prove consistent performance. Financial institutions see risk, not reliability.

This isolation prevents network effects. Instead of growing together, businesses struggle alone.

The roles, constraints, and missed connections across this system are explored further in our  
[Stakeholder Map](./stakeholder-map).

## Naming the Real Challenge

At first, we thought the challenge was helping merchants attract more customers.

That framing was incomplete.

The deeper challenge is this:

Youth-run micro-enterprises have trust and loyalty, but no way to capture, share, or translate it into stability and growth.

Without shared visibility and credible data, merchants remain invisible to financiers, partners, and even potential customers. Growth feels risky, and survival becomes the priority.

This understanding shaped our  
[Problem Statement](./problem-statement),  
moving the focus from marketing tactics to economic resilience.

## How We Changed

This process changed how we think about loyalty and growth.

We stopped seeing loyalty as discounts or points and started seeing it as proof of trust. Trust already exists in these communities. What is missing is a way to make it visible and useful beyond one shop.

We also realized that technology must not add burden. Merchants do not need complex dashboards or systems that demand constant attention. They need tools that quietly strengthen what already works.

Our internal shift, from growth thinking to resilience thinking, is explored more deeply in our  
[Team Reflection](./reflection).

## The Direction Forward

What this work points toward is a future where small merchants are no longer isolated.

A future where loyalty can travel across businesses.  
Where performance can be demonstrated without paperwork.  
Where access to capital reflects real community trust.  

Any future solution here must reduce risk, not add complexity.

For youth-run businesses, growth only becomes possible once survival is no longer fragile.
