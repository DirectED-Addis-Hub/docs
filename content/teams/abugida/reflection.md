# 🧠 Team Reflection Summary — Abugida

When we began, we framed the problem as a **loyalty program gap**. We assumed small businesses simply needed better tools to reward repeat customers.

After listening to young merchants in Addis Ababa, we realized loyalty was never the issue. **Trust already exists.** What is missing is stability and the ability to grow beyond a narrow circle.

Many shop owners told us they are stuck in survival mode. They cannot take risks, invest, or plan long-term because income is unpredictable. Even loyal customers cannot protect them from sudden rent hikes or slow weeks.

This shifted our perspective. We stopped thinking about loyalty as points or discounts and started thinking about **shared economic resilience**.

For us, the opportunity lies in transforming fragmented, cash-based loyalty into something that can:
- Increase visibility across multiple merchants
- Create network effects instead of isolation
- Provide data that helps unlock fair financing
- Allow customers to become real supporters, not just buyers

Technology, in this context, must be careful. If it extracts value or adds complexity, it fails.

Our core insight is this:  
**Small businesses don’t need to be “optimized.” They need to be connected.**  
Growth should come from cooperation and shared trust, not competition alone.
