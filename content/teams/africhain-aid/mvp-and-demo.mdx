# AfriChainAid

## Problem
Aid distribution in crisis settings is paper-based and opaque, leading to mismanagement, exclusion, and loss of trust among beneficiaries and donors.

## MVP

### Scope
- Register beneficiaries with a digital identity anchor
- Issue aid tokens as restricted vouchers
- Track redemption with an auditable trail

### Cardano Integration
Cardano serves as the immutable ledger for aid distribution, using native assets and smart contracts to enforce fair rules and transparency.
