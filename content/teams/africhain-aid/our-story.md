# Our Story – Africhain Aid

## Where We Entered

We entered this work through communities shaped by displacement, including internally displaced people and refugees whose daily survival depends on aid systems they do not design or control. At first, what we encountered appeared to be a distribution problem, with food shortages, long queues, missed deliveries, and exhausted volunteers, but the longer we stayed, the clearer it became that this situation was not only about logistics. It was about trust, dignity, and whether people felt seen by the systems meant to support them.

## What We Heard and Observed

As we listened across different camps and locations, the same stories repeated themselves as people spoke about missing meals and rations that never last the full month, while others described losing identification documents during violence or displacement and discovering that without papers they could not access food, healthcare, or protection. Volunteers shared a different kind of fear, explaining that when something goes wrong they are often blamed by the community even when failures originate higher in the system, allowing rumors to spread quickly and trust to collapse overnight. What stood out most was not only scarcity but uncertainty around who would be counted, who would be excluded, and who would be blamed, and these patterns and lived experiences are documented more fully in our [Community Essence Map](./community-essence-map).

## Where the System Breaks

As we mapped the ecosystem around aid delivery, deeper fractures became visible, with international organizations relying on reports and aggregated data, local administrators depending on paper lists and manual processes, volunteers operating through memory and trust, and communities relying on word of mouth, all without a shared source of truth. When records are unclear or missing, misinformation fills the gap, leading to people being counted twice while others are excluded entirely, volunteers becoming targets of accusation, institutions losing credibility, and communities losing faith in the system. The people most affected are those with the least power to correct mistakes, particularly women, children, and vulnerable families, and this ecosystem and its tensions are explored further in our [Stakeholder Map](./stakeholder-map).

## Naming the Real Challenge

At the beginning, we believed the core problem was theft or mismanagement, but that assumption did not hold. What we came to understand is that the absence of transparent and verifiable records creates a vacuum that becomes filled with mistrust, misinformation, and harm. Aid does not fail only when food is missing, it fails when truth is missing, and without reliable ways to verify who is registered, what was distributed, and when it happened, even well intentioned systems begin to break down. This understanding shaped how we framed our problem statement and shifted the focus away from blame toward accountability that protects everyone involved.

## How We Changed

This work changed how we think about technology by moving our attention away from tracking inventory and toward protecting people, especially those caught between institutions and communities. We came to see that misinformation can cause severe harm, since a rumor can destroy trust in a single day, an accusation can put a volunteer at risk, and an error can exclude a family from food or medical care. In this context, technology is not primarily about efficiency, but about restoring shared truth, and our internal shift from technical thinking to human responsibility is explored more deeply in our [Team Reflection](./reflection).

## The Direction Forward

What this work points toward is not only a better system but a different posture, one where aid delivery is verifiable to the community, volunteers are protected through transparency, institutions are accountable without becoming adversarial, and displaced people are not reduced to fragile entries on paper lists. Any future solution must earn trust before it earns scale, because in places shaped by displacement, trust is not optional but functions as survival infrastructure.
