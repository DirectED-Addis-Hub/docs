# Our Story - Africhain Aid

## Where We Entered

We entered this work through communities shaped by displacement. Internally displaced people and refugees whose daily survival depends on aid systems they do not design or control.

At first, what we encountered looked like a distribution problem. Food shortages, long queues, missed deliveries, and exhausted volunteers. But the longer we stayed, the clearer it became that this was not only about logistics.

This was about trust, dignity, and whether people felt seen by the systems meant to support them.

## What We Heard and Observed

As we listened across different camps and locations, the same stories repeated themselves.

People spoke about missing meals and rations that never last the full month. Others told us about losing identification documents during violence or displacement, only to find that without papers, they could not access food, healthcare, or protection.

Volunteers shared a different kind of fear. When something goes wrong, they are often blamed by the community, even when the failure comes from higher up the system. Rumors spread quickly, and trust can collapse overnight.

What stood out most was not only scarcity, but uncertainty.

Who will be counted this time?  
Who will be excluded?  
Who will be blamed?

These patterns and lived experiences are documented more fully in our  
[Community Essence Map](./community-essence-map).

## Where the System Breaks

As we mapped the ecosystem around aid delivery, deeper fractures became visible.

International organizations rely on reports and aggregated data.  
Local administrators rely on paper lists and manual processes.  
Volunteers rely on memory and trust.  
Communities rely on word of mouth.

There is no shared source of truth.

When records are unclear or missing, misinformation fills the gap. Some people are counted twice, others not at all. Volunteers become targets of accusation. Institutions lose credibility. Communities lose faith in the system.

The people most affected are those with the least power to correct mistakes, especially women, children, and vulnerable families.

This ecosystem and its tensions are explored further in our  
[Stakeholder Map](./stakeholder-map).

## Naming the Real Challenge

At the beginning, we thought the core problem was theft or mismanagement.

That assumption did not hold.

What we came to understand is this:

The absence of transparent and verifiable records creates a vacuum. That vacuum is filled by mistrust, misinformation, and harm.

Aid does not fail only when food is missing.  
It fails when truth is missing.

Without reliable ways to verify who is registered, what was distributed, and when it happened, even well intentioned systems begin to break down.

This understanding shaped how we framed our  
[Problem Statement](./problem-statement),  
moving the focus away from blame and toward accountability that protects everyone involved.

## How We Changed

This work changed how we think about technology.

We stopped thinking about tracking inventory and started thinking about protecting people. Especially those caught between institutions and communities.

We realized that misinformation can cause more harm than lost supplies. A rumor can destroy trust in a single day. An accusation can put a volunteer at risk. An error can exclude a family from food or medical care.

Technology, in this context, is not about efficiency first.  
It is about restoring shared truth.

Our internal shift from technical thinking to human responsibility is explored more deeply in our  
[Team Reflection](./reflection).

## The Direction Forward

What this work points toward is not just a better system, but a different posture.

One where aid delivery is verifiable to the community.  
Where volunteers are protected by transparency.  
Where institutions are accountable without being adversarial.  
Where displaced people are not reduced to fragile entries on paper lists.

Any future solution here must earn trust before it earns scale.

In places shaped by displacement, trust is not optional.  
It is survival infrastructure.
