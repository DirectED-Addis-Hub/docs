# 🧠 Team Reflection Summary — Africhain Aid

When we started this work, we believed the core problem in aid distribution was **theft or mismanagement**. Our early assumptions focused on “how to track resources better” and “how to stop loss.”

However, after listening to people in camps and speaking with volunteers, our understanding changed fundamentally.

What we encountered again and again was **fear, mistrust, and emotional harm** caused not only by missing aid, but by **misinformation and exclusion**. People spoke about being counted incorrectly, losing documents, or being accused of cheating the system. Volunteers spoke about being blamed for shortages they did not cause. In some cases, rumors escalated faster than institutions could respond.

We realized that misinformation and lack of verifiability can cause deeper harm than the physical loss of aid itself. Trust breaks quickly, and once it is broken, even well-intentioned interventions are rejected.

This shifted our framing completely. We stopped thinking only about inventory and logistics, and started thinking about **dignity, protection, and trust**. Technology, for us, is no longer just about efficiency. It must:
- Make aid delivery **verifiable** to the community
- Protect caretakers and volunteers from false accusations
- Preserve human dignity by reducing uncertainty and exclusion
- Create shared truth that does not rely on rumors or power dynamics

Our core insight is simple but heavy:  
**If people cannot trust the system that is meant to help them, the system itself becomes a source of harm.**

Any technological solution in this context must restore trust first—only then can efficiency matter.
