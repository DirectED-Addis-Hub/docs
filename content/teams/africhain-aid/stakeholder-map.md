# 🗺️ Stakeholder Map — Africhain Aid

**Goal:** transparency in aid distribution.

## Stakeholders

### Caretakers / local distributors / volunteers
- **Role:** deliver aid, trusted locally, vulnerable to rumors/accusations.
- **Platform role:** immutable distribution records + automation that protects reputation.

### Institutions (INGOs, UN agencies like WFP/UNHCR, camp admins, police, donors)
- **Role:** control funding/policy/lists; opaque reporting drives mistrust.
- **Platform role:** audit trails + monitoring visibility + dispute prevention.

### Emerging leaders (youth, tech-literate community members, influencers)
- **Role:** shape information flow; can amplify rumors or transparency.
- **Platform role:** verifiable records to counter misinformation.

### Groups affected (IDPs/refugees, women/children/vulnerable families)
- **Role:** recipients; harmed most by exclusion and mismanagement.
- **Platform role:** digital IDs + tracking to ensure entitled access and safety.
