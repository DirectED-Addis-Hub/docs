## Problem Title
Lack of Accountability and Trust in African Governance and Digital Commerce

## Overview
Endubis is exploring how to build more accountable, transparent systems for governance and digital commerce. Today, many citizens and online workers feel they have limited recourse when disputes arise, whether in public services or digital marketplaces.

## Who Experiences This Problem
- Citizens interacting with public institutions  
- Digital workers, freelancers, and entrepreneurs  
- P2P merchants who rely on online trust  
- Communities affected by opaque decisions and processes  

## Why This Matters
Lack of clear, fair, and auditable mechanisms erodes trust and limits participation in both governance and online economies. Better transparency and verifiable records can empower individuals and reduce systemic abuse.
