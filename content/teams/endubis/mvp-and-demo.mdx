# Endubis — Gadaa Protocol

## Problem
Digital freelancers and small businesses lack affordable and legitimate dispute resolution. Courts are slow and expensive, while many decentralized systems concentrate power among token-wealthy participants, creating trust friction.

## MVP

### Scope
- Escrow contract to lock funds during agreements
- Court contract to resolve disputes and issue binding outcomes
- Appeal and escalation logic

### Cardano Integration
Built on Cardano using Aiken:
- Escrow smart contract locks and releases funds
- Court smart contract selects jurors, enforces consensus, and signals verdicts to escrow
