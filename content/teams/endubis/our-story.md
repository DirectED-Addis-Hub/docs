# Our Story

## Where We Entered

We entered this work through conversations about digital trade and decentralized systems across Africa. People were building, trading, and collaborating online, yet many told us the same thing. When something goes wrong, there is nowhere affordable or accessible to turn.

At first, this sounded like a technical gap in smart contracts or platform tooling. Over time, we realized it was something more fundamental.

This was not only about code.  
It was about justice and trust.

## What We Heard and Observed

Builders, entrepreneurs, and digital traders shared repeated experiences of unresolved disputes. Agreements are made online, value is exchanged, and then a disagreement appears. When that happens, the options are limited.

Courts are slow, expensive, and often impractical for digital transactions. Centralized platforms step in as arbiters, but their decisions are opaque and final. Many people simply walk away from disputes because enforcing a claim costs more than the claim itself.

What repeated itself was resignation. People adjust their behavior to avoid risk rather than rely on systems to resolve it.

These patterns and lived experiences are captured more fully in our  
[Community Essence Map](./community-essence-map).

## Where the System Breaks

As we mapped the ecosystem, the break became clear.

Decentralized platforms promise peer to peer exchange.  
Traditional justice systems move slowly and offline.  
Centralized intermediaries fill the gap by force of convenience.  

There is no accessible justice layer that fits the speed and scale of digital commerce.

This mismatch concentrates power, weakens trust, and discourages participation. People avoid innovation not because they lack ideas, but because they fear unresolved conflict.

The roles, incentives, and power dynamics across this system are explored further in our  
[Stakeholder Map](./stakeholder-map).

## Naming the Real Challenge

Initially, we framed the challenge as enforcing smart contracts.

That framing did not go far enough.

The deeper challenge is this:

Digital agreements operate without a justice mechanism that is affordable, legitimate, and trusted by the communities using them.

Without such a mechanism, decentralization reproduces the same failures it claims to escape. Power shifts, but accountability does not improve.

This understanding shaped our  
[Problem Statement](./problem-statement),  
moving the focus from execution of code to legitimacy of outcomes.

## How We Changed

This process changed how we think about governance.

We stopped seeing justice as something external to technology and started seeing it as a core requirement for cooperation. A system that cannot resolve conflict fairly cannot sustain trust.

We were drawn to indigenous governance models like the Gadaa system because they emphasize consensus, accountability, and social legitimacy. What matters is not only whether a decision is enforced, but whether people accept it as fair.

Technology here must support judgment, not replace it. It must create space for human values to operate at digital scale.

Our internal shift and reasoning are explored more deeply in our  
[Team Reflection](./reflection).

## The Direction Forward

What this work points toward is a digital economy where conflict does not automatically collapse into power or silence.

Where disputes can be resolved without prohibitive cost.  
Where outcomes are transparent and understandable.  
Where legitimacy matters as much as enforcement.  

Any future solution here must earn trust culturally, not just technically.

In decentralized systems, justice is not an add on.  
It is the foundation that makes cooperation possible.
