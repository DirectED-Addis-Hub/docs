# Our Story

## Where We Entered

We entered this work through conversations about digital trade and decentralized systems across Africa, where people were building, trading, and collaborating online while repeatedly telling us that when something goes wrong there is nowhere affordable or accessible to turn. At first, this appeared to be a technical gap in smart contracts or platform tooling, but over time we realized the issue was more fundamental. It was not only about code, but about justice and trust.

## What We Heard and Observed

Builders, entrepreneurs, and digital traders shared repeated experiences of unresolved disputes where agreements are made online, value is exchanged, and then a disagreement emerges with few viable options for resolution. Courts are slow, expensive, and impractical for many digital transactions, while centralized platforms step in as arbiters whose decisions are opaque and final, leading many people to walk away from disputes because enforcing a claim often costs more than the claim itself. What repeated itself was resignation, with people adjusting their behavior to avoid risk rather than relying on systems to resolve conflict, and these patterns and lived experiences are captured more fully in our [Community Essence Map](./community-essence-map).

## Where the System Breaks

As we mapped the ecosystem, the break became clear, with decentralized platforms promising peer to peer exchange, traditional justice systems operating slowly and offline, and centralized intermediaries filling the gap through convenience rather than legitimacy, leaving no accessible justice layer that fits the speed and scale of digital commerce. This mismatch concentrates power, weakens trust, and discourages participation, causing people to avoid innovation not because they lack ideas but because they fear unresolved conflict. The roles, incentives, and power dynamics across this system are explored further in our [Stakeholder Map](./stakeholder-map).

## Naming the Real Challenge

Initially, we framed the challenge as enforcing smart contracts, but that framing did not go far enough. The deeper challenge is that digital agreements operate without a justice mechanism that is affordable, legitimate, and trusted by the communities using them, and without such a mechanism decentralization reproduces the same failures it claims to escape, shifting power without improving accountability. This understanding shaped our [Problem Statement](./problem-statement) and moved the focus away from execution of code toward the legitimacy of outcomes.

## How We Changed

This process changed how we think about governance by leading us to see justice as a core requirement for cooperation rather than something external to technology, since a system that cannot resolve conflict fairly cannot sustain trust. We were drawn to indigenous governance models such as the Gadaa system because they emphasize consensus, accountability, and social legitimacy, showing that what matters is not only whether a decision is enforced but whether people accept it as fair. In this context, technology must support judgment rather than replace it and create space for human values to operate at digital scale, and our internal shift and reasoning are explored more deeply in our [Team Reflection](./reflection).

## The Direction Forward

This work points toward a digital economy where conflict does not automatically collapse into power or silence, where disputes can be resolved without prohibitive cost, outcomes are transparent and understandable, and legitimacy matters as much as enforcement. Any future solution must earn trust culturally rather than only technically, because in decentralized systems justice is not an add on but the foundation that makes cooperation possible.
