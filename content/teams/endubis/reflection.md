# 🧠 Team Reflection Summary — Endubis

We started with a technical question: how can smart contracts be enforced fairly without relying on centralized platforms?

As we explored the problem, it became clear that enforcement is not just a technical issue—it is a **justice issue**.

People told us that when disputes arise, they rarely seek formal resolution. Courts are too slow, too expensive, and too distant from the realities of digital trade. As a result, power concentrates in platforms or informal networks, recreating the very systems decentralization claims to solve.

This realization forced us to rethink what “justice” means in a digital context.

We were drawn to the Gadaa system not as a metaphor, but as a functioning model of **cyclical accountability, consensus, and legitimacy**. What matters is not only enforcement, but whether people accept the outcome as fair.

Our focus shifted from building “another protocol” to designing a **justice layer that people trust**:
- Low-cost and accessible
- Culturally legitimate
- Transparent and non-plutocratic
- Compatible with decentralized infrastructure

For us, blockchain is a tool—not the goal.  
If a system cannot resolve conflict fairly, it cannot sustain cooperation.

Our core belief now is this:  
**The future of decentralized systems depends on justice as much as it depends on code.**
