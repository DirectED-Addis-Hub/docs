# 🧭 Community Essence Map — Ethio-Origins

**Location:** Guji Zone, Oromia Region, Ethiopia  
**Focus area:** Smallholder coffee farmers practicing regenerative agriculture

## Stories from the community

Farmers in Guji described coffee production as both a livelihood and an inherited responsibility. Their farms are shaded by Enset and native trees, and chemical inputs are rare—not because of certification, but because this is how farming has always been done.

Despite this, farmers repeatedly told us that once coffee leaves their hands, **their identity disappears**.

One farmer explained that when he delivers red cherries to the washing station, his name becomes a number on a paper receipt. That receipt is often the only proof of ownership and quality, and it is easily lost or disputed.

Another shared that his coffee may later be sold internationally as “premium specialty,” yet he has no way to prove that it came from his land or that it met higher standards.

## Observations (what keeps repeating)

- Coffee quality and regenerative practices are invisible beyond the farm gate.
- Paper-based records are fragile and easily lost or manipulated.
- Farmers do not know final prices or destinations of their coffee.
- Washing stations act as information choke points.
- Certification systems exist but are too expensive or inaccessible for most farmers.

## Patterns, tensions, and themes

- **Pattern:** High-quality production, low recognition
- **Pattern:** Information loss at point of aggregation
- **Tension:** Global demand for traceability vs. local data absence
- **Tension:** Regenerative practice vs. extractive market systems
- **Theme:** Farmer invisibility
- **Theme:** Trust gaps across the value chain

## A typical journey of coffee

Cultivation → hand harvesting → delivery to washing station → paper receipt → aggregation → export → global sale  
  
At the point of sale, the farmer’s story ends—while the coffee’s value continues to rise.
