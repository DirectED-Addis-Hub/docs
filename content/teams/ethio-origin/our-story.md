# Our Story

## Where We Entered

We entered this work through the Guji Zone of Ethiopia, where smallholder farmers practice regenerative agriculture as a way of life rather than a trend.

From the outside, these farms produce high quality crops with deep cultural and environmental value. From the inside, farmers told us a different story. One where their work disappears the moment it leaves their hands.

What initially looked like a market access problem quickly revealed itself as an identity problem.

---

## What We Heard and Observed

Farmers repeatedly told us that once their crops are sold, their identity is erased. Coffee and other produce move through paper based supply chains where origin, farming practices, and regenerative effort are lost.

Several farmers explained that they cannot prove the quality of their work to buyers. Exporters told us that they often struggle to validate origin claims, even when they trust the farmers personally. Disputes over quality and pricing are common, and farmers usually lose.

What stood out was not a lack of value, but a lack of visibility.

These patterns and lived experiences are documented in detail in our  
[Community Essence Map](./community-essence-map).

## Where the System Breaks

As we mapped the ecosystem, a clear gap appeared between production and consumption.

Farmers rely on trust and tradition.  
Buyers rely on documentation and verification.  
The supply chain in between relies on paper, memory, and fragmented records.

This creates what many described to us as a data black hole. At the point of sale, the farmer’s identity disappears. With it goes proof of regenerative practices, origin, and care.

This gap allows price manipulation, weak bargaining power, and exclusion from premium markets. Farmers do the work, but others capture the value.

The roles, incentives, and imbalances across this system are explored further in our  
[Stakeholder Map](./stakeholder-map).

## Naming the Real Challenge

At first, we framed the challenge as improving traceability.

That framing was incomplete.

The deeper challenge is this:

Farmers practicing regenerative agriculture cannot carry their identity through the supply chain, and without identity, their value cannot be recognized.

This is not only an economic issue. It affects trust, pride, and long term sustainability. When regenerative work is invisible, there is little incentive to continue it.

This understanding shaped our  
[Problem Statement](./problem-statement),  
shifting the focus from tracking goods to validating people and practices.

## How We Changed

This process changed how we think about origin.

We stopped seeing traceability as a compliance requirement and started seeing it as a form of recognition. Farmers do not just want better prices. They want their work to be seen, respected, and carried forward honestly.

We also realized that trust must be shared. Buyers need confidence in claims. Farmers need confidence that the system will not erase them again.

Technology, in this context, must not overpower local practices. It must quietly support them.

Our shift in perspective is explored more deeply in our  
[Team Reflection](./reflection).

## The Direction Forward

What this work points toward is a future where farmers remain visible from field to consumer.

A future where regenerative practices are provable.  
Where farmers can access fairer markets.  
Where value flows back to the people who create it.

Any future solution here must respect local context while meeting global trust requirements.

In agriculture, origin is not a label. It is the story of people, land, and care.
