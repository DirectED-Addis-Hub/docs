# 🧠 Team Reflection Summary — Ethio-Origins

When we began this work, we were excited by the technical possibilities of blockchain—smart contracts, metadata, and immutable records. We initially framed the problem as a **data integrity challenge**.

After listening to farmers in Guji, our perspective shifted.

What we encountered was not just missing data, but **missing identity**. Farmers repeatedly told us that once their coffee leaves the farm, their name, effort, and practices disappear. The market sees the coffee, but not the person behind it.

We realized that paper receipts are more than inefficient—they are fragile symbols of trust. When those papers are lost, farmers lose their voice in the value chain.

This forced us to slow down and rethink our approach. Connectivity is limited. Electricity is unreliable. Any solution that assumes constant access fails immediately.

Our insight became clear:  
**Technology must work for farmers where they are—not where the market assumes they are.**

For us, blockchain is not about speculation or complexity. It is about:
- Preserving farmer identity
- Making regenerative practices visible
- Creating proof that survives aggregation and export
- Restoring dignity and bargaining power

We are no longer building “a supply-chain product.”  
We are trying to ensure that when coffee is sold as premium, **the farmer is no longer invisible**.
