# 🧭 Community Essence Map — Genius by Mistake

**Location:** Bishoftu, Mojo, and Arsi  
**Focus area:** Agricultural traceability and farmer identity (AgriTrace)

## Stories from the community

Farmers told us that once their produce leaves their hands, **its identity disappears**. Coffee, grains, and other crops are mixed, relabeled, or resold without any reliable way to prove origin.

One farmer explained that when buyers question quality or authenticity, the farmer has no evidence to defend their work. Exporters shared that shipments are sometimes rejected because origin cannot be verified, even when the product is high quality.

Across locations, the same frustration came up: trust breaks down not because people are dishonest, but because **there is no shared proof**.

## Observations (what keeps repeating)

- Produce loses identity immediately after aggregation.
- Farmers are blamed when quality is disputed, but lack proof.
- Buyers and exporters struggle to verify authenticity.
- Price manipulation is common due to information asymmetry.
- Rejected exports cause financial loss for everyone involved.

## Patterns, Tensions, and Themes

**Patterns**
- High-quality production paired with low trust downstream  
- Loss of producer identity at aggregation points  

**Tensions**
- Farmer credibility versus persistent market skepticism  
- Manual, paper-based systems versus global trade standards  

**Themes**
- Traceability as a prerequisite for trust  
- Economic harm resulting from missing or unreliable data  

## A typical produce journey

Harvest → aggregation → transport → resale/export → dispute or price drop

At each step, the farmer’s voice becomes quieter.
