# Genius by Mistake — AgriTrace

> **Team Lead:** Aneni Kidanu  
> **Location:** Addis Ababa

## Problem
Agricultural supply chains in Ethiopia lack transparency. As products move through multiple intermediaries, smallholder farmers lose product identity and fair pricing. Exporters struggle to source reliably verified goods, and global consumers cannot confirm origin or ethical claims. This breaks trust across the entire chain and limits farmers’ access to higher-value markets.

## MVP

### Scope
The MVP demonstrates a **farm-to-consumer traceability system**:
- Each agricultural batch is assigned a unique digital identity
- Supply-chain events are recorded immutably
- Consumers and buyers can verify origin and journey via QR scan

### Cardano Integration
Cardano is used as the **product identity and trust layer**:
- **Product Identity Tokens:** Each batch is minted as a Cardano Native Asset
- **On-Chain Metadata:** Origin, harvest date, and farmer identifiers are stored in token metadata
- **Immutable Journey Log:** Each handover creates an on-chain transaction, forming a tamper-proof timeline
- **QR Verification:** Scanning a QR fetches live token metadata from Cardano
- **Farmer Reputation:** Farmers build a verifiable reputation through historical on-chain activity tied to their products
