# Our Story

## Where We Entered

We entered this work through farming communities in Bishoftu, Mojo, and Arsi. These are places where people grow high quality produce with care and experience, yet struggle to have that value recognized once their crops leave the farm.

At first, the issue looked like a market standards problem. Buyers questioned quality, exporters worried about compliance, and farmers were pressured on price. As we listened more closely, we realized something more basic was missing.

This was not only about quality.  
It was about identity and proof.

## What We Heard and Observed

Farmers told us that once their produce is aggregated, their identity disappears. Crops are mixed, relabeled, or moved through chains where origin cannot be verified. When disputes arise, farmers have no evidence to defend their work.

Exporters shared that shipments are sometimes rejected because origin cannot be confirmed, even when the product is good. Buyers described mistrust and hesitation, knowing that paperwork often does not reflect reality on the ground.

What repeated itself was loss of voice. The people who do the work are the least able to prove it.

These experiences and patterns are documented more fully in our  
[Community Essence Map](./community-essence-map).

## Where the System Breaks

As we mapped the ecosystem, the break appeared at aggregation and handoff points.

Farmers rely on trust and experience.  
Aggregators rely on speed and volume.  
Exporters and buyers rely on documentation.  

Paper based systems cannot carry identity across these transitions. As a result, information asymmetry grows. Prices are manipulated, disputes increase, and risk is pushed back onto farmers.

The roles, incentives, and power imbalances across this system are explored further in our  
[Stakeholder Map](./stakeholder-map).

## Naming the Real Challenge

Initially, we framed the challenge as traceability for export compliance.

That framing was incomplete.

The deeper challenge is this:

When produce moves without identity, trust collapses across the value chain, and value is destroyed for everyone involved.

Without shared proof of origin and handling, farmers lose bargaining power, exporters face risk, and buyers lack confidence.

This understanding shaped our  
[Problem Statement](./problem-statement),  
shifting the focus from tracking goods to protecting identity and trust.

## How We Changed

This process changed how we think about traceability.

We stopped seeing it as a technical requirement and started seeing it as a form of fairness. Farmers do not just want access to markets. They want recognition for their work and protection from disputes they cannot control.

We also realized that a solution that benefits only one actor will fail. Trust must be shared across the entire chain, from farm to buyer.

Technology here must make truth visible without adding burden to farmers.

Our internal shift and priorities are explored more deeply in our  
[Team Reflection](./reflection).

## The Direction Forward

What this work points toward is an agricultural system where origin remains visible throughout the journey.

Where farmers can stand behind their products.  
Where exporters can verify claims confidently.  
Where buyers can trust what they purchase.  

Any future solution here must reduce conflict, not add complexity.

In agriculture, trust is not abstract.  
It determines who gets paid, who bears risk, and who is believed.
