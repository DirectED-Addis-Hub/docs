# 🧠 Team Reflection Summary — Genius by Mistake

At the beginning, we thought the problem was mainly about **export compliance and tracking**. We assumed traceability was a technical feature needed for international markets.

After listening to farmers and traders, we realized the issue is much more personal.

Farmers spoke about feeling powerless when their products were questioned. Once crops leave their hands, they lose control over the story, the price, and sometimes even their reputation. When shipments are rejected or prices drop, the consequences fall hardest on them.

This changed our framing. Traceability is not just about logistics—it is about **voice and fairness**.

We began to see how missing data creates room for manipulation, disputes, and mistrust. Everyone suffers: farmers, traders, exporters, and buyers. But farmers suffer first.

Our focus shifted from “tracking goods” to **protecting identity**:
- Giving farmers proof they can stand behind
- Reducing disputes through shared records
- Restoring confidence across the value chain

For us, technology must do one thing above all: **make the truth visible to everyone involved**.

Our core insight is this:  
**When origin is invisible, trust collapses. When trust collapses, value is destroyed.**
