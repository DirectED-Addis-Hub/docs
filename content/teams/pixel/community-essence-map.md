# 🧭 Community Essence Map — Pixel

**Location:** Addis Ababa (Merkato area)  
**Focus area:** Female startup weavers and handmade garment sellers

## Key stories & voices from the community

- **Hana (29, handloom weaver):**  
  “If you don’t have a shop sign or marketing, people don’t even notice your work.”

- **Selam (24, home-based weaver):**  
  “I can’t afford a shop. Without advertising, people don’t take my business seriously.”

- **Meselech (35, weaver):**  
  “Selling is slow. Shops take a big cut, and sometimes I go home with nothing.”

- **Local buyer:**  
  “I don’t know who is genuine and who is a middleman. I just see prices changing.”

- **Older weaver:**  
  “Outside Merkato, we are invisible.”

## Observations (what keeps repeating)

- Stall rents commonly range between **10,000–20,000 ETB per month**.
- Middlemen dominate access to buyers and capture most margins.
- Marketing is informal and visibility-dependent (foot traffic, shouting).
- Many women work from home or shared spaces and remain unseen.
- Buyers want authenticity but lack verification mechanisms.
- Digital tools are desired but feel risky and inaccessible.

## Patterns, tensions, and themes

- **Pattern:** High skill, low visibility
- **Pattern:** Income instability driven by location and season
- **Tension:** Craft authenticity vs. buyer trust
- **Tension:** Creativity vs. structural barriers
- **Theme:** Gendered economic exclusion
- **Theme:** Absence of trusted digital identity

## A typical day (condensed)

Production → attempt to sell via shops or foot traffic → negotiation with middlemen → inconsistent income → unsold goods → repeat.
