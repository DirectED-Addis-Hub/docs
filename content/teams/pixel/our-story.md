# Our Story

## Where We Entered

We entered this work through Merkato, a place full of movement, skill, and creativity, but also constant pressure to survive day to day.

Our first encounters were with women who weave, design, and sell handmade garments. Their work is visible everywhere in the market, yet the people behind it are rarely recognized beyond their immediate surroundings. What initially appeared to be a market access issue quickly revealed itself as something deeper.

This was not a lack of talent.  
It was a lack of visibility, stability, and control.

## What We Heard and Observed

As we spent time listening, the same stories surfaced repeatedly.

Female startup weavers told us they rely heavily on middlemen to reach customers. Stall rents are high, foot traffic is unpredictable, and marketing is almost entirely informal. Many sell high quality products, yet struggle to explain their value or reach buyers beyond the local market.

Income fluctuates constantly. One good week can be followed by several bad ones. Planning becomes difficult, and long term growth feels risky.

What stood out most was not the absence of buyers, but the absence of a trusted bridge between artisans and the people who want to support them.

These lived realities are documented more fully in our  
[Community Essence Map](./community-essence-map).

## Where the System Breaks

As we mapped the ecosystem, the fragmentation became clear.

Artisans operate individually.  
Middlemen control access.  
Buyers lack direct relationships with creators.  

There is no shared platform that represents the collective strength of these women.

Because there is no trusted digital space, artisans remain invisible beyond Merkato, buyers struggle to verify authenticity, and cultural products lose both value and story.

This fragmentation benefits intermediaries while leaving creators economically insecure.

The full ecosystem and the power dynamics within it are explored further in our  
[Stakeholder Map](./stakeholder-map).

## Naming the Real Challenge

At first, we framed the challenge as building an online marketplace.

That framing did not go far enough.

The deeper challenge is this:

Female artisans are producing cultural and economic value, but they do not control how that value is presented, trusted, or sustained.

Without a trusted and shared space, their work remains undervalued, their income remains unstable, and their cultural contribution risks being diluted or lost.

This understanding shaped how we articulated our  
[Problem Statement](./problem-statement),  
moving beyond commerce toward dignity and long term empowerment.

## How We Changed

This process changed how we think about platforms.

We stopped seeing technology as a sales channel and started seeing it as representation.

Listening to these women made it clear that empowerment is not only about selling more. It is about being seen clearly, fairly, and on their own terms. A platform that extracts value or treats artisans as listings would fail the people it claims to support.

We also realized that trust must work in both directions. Buyers need confidence in authenticity, and artisans need confidence that their work and identity are respected.

This internal shift is reflected more deeply in our  
[Team Reflection](./reflection).

## The Direction Forward

What this work points toward is not simply an online store, but a shared space where female weavers control their narrative, buyers connect directly with creators, cultural products retain their meaning, and income becomes more predictable and dignified.

Any future solution here must balance reach with respect.

In communities like Merkato, economic empowerment begins with being seen, not just being sold.
