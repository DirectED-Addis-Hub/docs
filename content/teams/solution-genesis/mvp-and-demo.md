# Solution Genesis

## Problem
Skilled freelancers in Ethiopia can secure international work, but getting paid is unreliable. Global payment tools like PayPal and Stripe are unavailable, while bank transfers are slow, expensive, and unpredictable. As a result, freelancers lose income, wait weeks for payments, or rely on risky intermediaries—blocking full participation in the global digital economy.

## MVP

### Scope
The MVP provides a **milestone-based escrow payment flow** for freelance work:
- Clients lock payments in escrow
- Funds are released per milestone
- Disputes and refunds are handled without intermediaries

The MVP does not attempt to replace full freelance marketplaces or banking systems.

### Core Users
- Freelancers
- International clients

### Cardano Integration
Cardano smart contracts act as the **payment and trust layer**. Funds are locked in escrow on-chain and released automatically when conditions are met. This removes reliance on intermediaries and provides transparent, predictable settlement across borders.
