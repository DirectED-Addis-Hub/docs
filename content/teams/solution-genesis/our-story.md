# Our Story

## Where We Entered

We entered this work through conversations with freelancers who earn their living online while living in Ethiopia.

From the outside, the digital economy promises freedom and global opportunity. From the inside, freelancers told us a different story. One where finding work is possible, but getting paid is uncertain.

What initially looked like a payment integration issue quickly revealed itself as a question of security and dignity.

## What We Heard and Observed

Freelancers consistently described the same cycle. They complete work for international clients, then spend days or weeks worrying about how payments will arrive.

Many shared experiences of delayed bank transfers, high fees, and sudden changes in which platforms work locally. Others rely on friends abroad or informal intermediaries to receive payments, adding stress and risk.

What repeated itself was not a lack of demand for skills, but a lack of confidence in the payment process.

This uncertainty shapes how people choose clients, negotiate contracts, and plan their lives. It affects mental health, household stability, and long term career growth.

These experiences are captured more fully in our  
[Community Essence Map](./community-essence-map).

## Where the System Breaks

As we mapped the ecosystem, the gap became clear.

Global clients and platforms assume standard payment tools.  
Local freelancers face restrictions, fees, and delays.  
Banks operate within regulatory constraints that do not align with digital work flows.  

There is no simple bridge between global income and local access.

This forces freelancers into workarounds that are fragile and often informal. When a workaround fails, income disappears without warning.

The roles, constraints, and incentives across this system are explored further in our  
[Stakeholder Map](./stakeholder-map).

## Naming the Real Challenge

At first, we framed the challenge as building a new payment rail.

That framing missed the deeper issue.

The real challenge is this:

Freelancers can earn globally, but cannot rely on predictable and compliant ways to receive their income locally.

When payment is uncertain, work itself becomes unstable. People hesitate to accept opportunities, and long term growth becomes risky.

This understanding shaped our  
[Problem Statement](./problem-statement),  
shifting the focus from speed of payment to reliability and trust.

## How We Changed

This process changed how we think about financial technology.

We stopped focusing on moving money quickly and started focusing on reducing anxiety around income. For freelancers, predictability matters more than novelty.

We also realized that any solution must work within local rules rather than bypass them. Trust is built when systems are understandable, compliant, and consistent over time.

Technology here should feel boring in the best way. It should work quietly, every time.

Our internal shift and design priorities are explored more deeply in our  
[Team Reflection](./reflection).

## The Direction Forward

What this work points toward is a future where freelancers can accept global work with confidence.

Where payments arrive reliably.  
Where fees are clear and fair.  
Where income planning is possible.  

Any future solution here must prioritize trust over speed and stability over shortcuts.

In the digital economy, freedom only exists when income is predictable.
