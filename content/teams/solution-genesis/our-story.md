# Our Story

## Where We Entered

We entered this work through conversations with freelancers who earn their living online while living in Ethiopia.

From the outside, the digital economy promises freedom and global opportunity. From the inside, freelancers told us a different story. One where finding work is possible, but getting paid is uncertain.

What initially looked like a payment integration issue quickly revealed itself as a question of security and dignity.

## What We Heard and Observed

Freelancers consistently described the same cycle. They complete work for international clients, then spend days or weeks worrying about how payments will arrive.

Many shared experiences of delayed bank transfers, high fees, and sudden changes in which platforms work locally. Others rely on friends abroad or informal intermediaries to receive payments, adding stress and risk.

What repeated itself was not a lack of demand for skills, but a lack of confidence in the payment process.

This uncertainty shapes how people choose clients, negotiate contracts
