# Our Story

## Where We Entered

We entered this work through conversations with freelancers who earn their living online while living in Ethiopia, where the digital economy promises freedom and global opportunity from the outside but feels very different from within. Freelancers told us that while finding work is often possible, getting paid remains uncertain, and what initially appeared to be a payment integration issue revealed itself as a deeper question of security and dignity.

## What We Heard and Observed

Freelancers consistently described a cycle in which they complete work for international clients and then spend days or weeks worrying about how payments will arrive. Many shared experiences of delayed bank transfers, high fees, and sudden changes in which platforms work locally, while others rely on friends abroad or informal intermediaries to receive payments, adding stress and risk. What repeated itself was not a lack of demand for skills but a lack of confidence in the payment process, and this uncertainty shapes how people choose clients, negotiate contracts, and plan their lives, affecting mental health, household stability, and long term career growth. These experiences are captured more fully in our [Community Essence Map](./community-essence-map).

## Where the System Breaks

As we mapped the ecosystem, a clear gap emerged between global digital work and local financial access, with international clients and platforms assuming standard payment tools, local freelancers facing restrictions, fees, and delays, and banks operating within regulatory constraints that do not align with digital work flows. Because there is no simple bridge between global income and local access, freelancers are forced into fragile and often informal workarounds, and when one of these fails, income can disappear without warning. The roles, constraints, and incentives across this system are explored further in our [Stakeholder Map](./stakeholder-map).

## Naming the Real Challenge

At first, we framed the challenge as building a new payment rail, but that framing missed the deeper issue. The real challenge is that freelancers can earn income globally but cannot rely on predictable and compliant ways to receive it locally, and when payment is uncertain, work itself becomes unstable, causing people to hesitate before accepting opportunities and making long term growth feel risky. This understanding shaped our [Problem Statement](./problem-statement) and shifted the focus from speed of payment toward reliability and trust.

## How We Changed

This process changed how we think about financial technology by moving our attention away from moving money quickly and toward reducing anxiety around income. For freelancers, predictability matters more than novelty, and we also realized that any solution must work within local rules rather than bypass them, since trust is built when systems are understandable, compliant, and consistent over time. In this context, technology should work quietly and reliably, and our internal shift and design priorities are explored more deeply in our [Team Reflection](./reflection).

## The Direction Forward

This work points toward a future where freelancers can accept global work with confidence, receive payments reliably, understand fees clearly, and plan their income with stability. Any future solution must prioritize trust over speed and stability over shortcuts, because in the digital economy freedom only exists when income is predictable.
