# 🧭 Community Essence Map — Stable Solutions

**Location:** Urban communities in Ethiopia  
**Focus area:** Prescription medication access and safety

## Stories from the community

People in our community told us that it is common to obtain prescription medicines directly from pharmacies without seeing a doctor. In many cases, this is not done out of negligence, but out of necessity. Medical consultations can be expensive, time consuming, or inaccessible.

Some shared stories of reusing old prescriptions or borrowing medicines recommended by friends and family. Others described situations where paper prescriptions were lost, damaged, or reused multiple times.

Health workers spoke about patients arriving with complications caused by incorrect medication use. In some cases, the harm was severe and irreversible, including loss of vision and long term health damage.

## Observations (what keeps repeating)

- Prescription medicines are widely accessible without verification.
- Paper prescriptions are easy to forge, reuse, or lose.
- Pharmacies lack tools to confirm prescription authenticity.
- Patients often prioritize convenience over safety.
- Preventable harm occurs due to misuse of medication.

## Patterns, Tensions, and Themes

**Patterns**
- Widespread access to prescription medicines without diagnosis or verification  
- Repeated reliance on paper prescriptions that are reused, forged, or lost  
- Preventable health complications caused by incorrect or prolonged medication use  

**Tensions**
- Convenience and speed of access versus patient safety and proper diagnosis  
- Informal pharmacy practices versus formal healthcare regulations  
- Individual coping strategies versus system-level responsibility for harm prevention  

**Themes**
- Fragility of prescription and verification systems  
- Preventable harm driven by weak trust and accountability mechanisms  
- The gap between safe medical practice and everyday access realities  


## A typical medication journey

Symptom appears → pharmacy visit without diagnosis → medication obtained → misuse or overuse → complications → delayed medical care

Harm often occurs not because people ignore health advice, but because safe access is harder than unsafe access.
