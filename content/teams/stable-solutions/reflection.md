# 🧠 Team Reflection Summary — Stable Solutions

When we started, we thought this was primarily a technology problem. Paper prescriptions were inefficient, so digitization seemed like the obvious answer.

As we listened more closely, we realized the issue was not just inefficiency. It was harm.

People are not misusing medication because they do not care about their health. They are doing so because the system makes unsafe access easier than safe access. When diagnosis is hard to reach and verification is weak, people rely on whatever option feels immediate.

This changed how we think about responsibility.

We stopped focusing on control and started focusing on protection. A prescription is not just an instruction. It is a safeguard. When that safeguard is fragile, people get hurt.

We also learned that any solution must respect real constraints. Pharmacies are busy. Patients are under pressure. Healthcare workers are overloaded. If a system adds friction, it will be ignored.

Our goal became clear. Technology should quietly support safe behavior, not punish unsafe behavior after the fact.

For us, success means that doing the right thing becomes the easiest thing. When safe medication access is simpler than unsafe access, harm can be prevented before it happens.
