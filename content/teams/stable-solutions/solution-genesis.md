# Solution Genesis

## Problem Title
Ethiopian Freelancers Payment System

## Overview
Solution Genesis is focused on helping Ethiopian freelancers receive international payments. Popular global services like PayPal are restricted, and local banking rules make it difficult to get paid from abroad in a reliable way.

## Who Experiences This Problem
- Freelancers and remote workers  
- Online creatives and digital service providers  
- Small agencies and teams serving global clients  

## Why This Matters
Payment friction blocks access to global work opportunities and stable income. A safer, more predictable cross-border payment path can unlock economic mobility for young Ethiopians who already have the skills but lack financial rails.
