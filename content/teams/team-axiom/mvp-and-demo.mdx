# Team Axiom

## Problem
Patient medical records are fragmented across hospitals and often paper-based. When patients move between facilities, their history does not follow them, leading to repeated tests, delays, and unsafe care.

## MVP

### Scope
- Upload medical record metadata off-chain
- Anchor a verification hash on Cardano
- Generate a QR code for record verification

### Cardano Integration
Cardano is used as a trust layer by storing immutable hashes of medical records. Providers verify authenticity without exposing sensitive patient data on-chain.
