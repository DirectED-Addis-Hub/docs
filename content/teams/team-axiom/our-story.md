# Our Story

## Where We Entered

We entered this work through everyday movement between health centers. Clinics referring patients, hospitals receiving them, and families trying to navigate the system while under stress.

What first caught our attention were small delays and missing papers. Referral notes that could not be verified. Patients being asked to repeat tests. Long waits caused by uncertainty rather than medical need.

At first glance, these looked like administrative issues. Over time, we realized they were symptoms of a deeper trust problem.

## What We Heard and Observed

Health workers told us that referrals often arrive incomplete or unverified. When a patient shows up without proper documentation, the receiving facility has no way to confirm what was done before.

Patients told us a different side of the story. They described being sent back and forth between facilities, carrying papers they do not fully understand, afraid that losing a single document could delay or deny care.

What repeated itself was not negligence, but fragility.

A fragile paper trail.  
A fragile chain of trust.  
A fragile experience for people who are already vulnerable.

These experiences and patterns are documented more fully in our  
[Community Essence Map](./community-essence-map).

## Where the System Breaks

As we mapped the ecosystem, the breakdown became clearer.

Health centers rely on paper referrals.  
Hospitals rely on trust in those papers.  
Patients rely on carrying documents safely across long distances.  

There is no shared system that allows facilities to verify referrals quickly and confidently.

This creates multiple points of failure. Referrals are questioned. Care is delayed. Patients repeat tests or are redirected unnecessarily. Trust between institutions weakens.

The roles, incentives, and risks across this system are explored further in our  
[Stakeholder Map](./stakeholder-map).

## Naming the Real Challenge

Initially, we thought the challenge was digitizing referrals.

That was only part of the picture.

The deeper challenge is this:

Healthcare referrals move across institutions without a reliable way to verify their authenticity, history, or integrity.

When verification is weak, care slows down. When care slows down, patients suffer. In urgent cases, these delays can be life threatening.

This understanding shaped our  
[Problem Statement](./problem-statement),  
moving the focus from paperwork efficiency to trust and continuity of care.

## How We Changed

This process changed how we think about healthcare technology.

We stopped focusing on systems alone and started focusing on patient experience. A referral is not just a document. It is a promise that care will continue smoothly.

We realized that trust in healthcare systems is built quietly. It depends on records that are reliable, verifiable, and easy to understand by professionals who are already overloaded.

Technology here must be lightweight and respectful. It must support coordination without creating new burdens.

Our internal shift and design priorities are explored more deeply in our  
[Team Reflection](./reflection).

## The Direction Forward

What this work points toward is a healthcare system where referrals are trusted across facilities.

Where health workers can verify information quickly.  
Where patients are not punished for missing or damaged papers.  
Where continuity of care is protected by shared truth rather than fragile documents.

Any future solution here must prioritize patient safety over technical complexity.

In healthcare, trust is not an abstract value.  
It directly shapes who receives care, when, and how.
