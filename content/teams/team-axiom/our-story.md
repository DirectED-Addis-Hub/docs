# Our Story

## Where We Entered

We entered this work through everyday movement between health centers, with clinics referring patients, hospitals receiving them, and families trying to navigate the system while under stress. What first caught our attention were small delays and missing papers, including referral notes that could not be verified, patients being asked to repeat tests, and long waits caused by uncertainty rather than medical need. At first glance these appeared to be administrative issues, but over time we realized they were symptoms of a deeper problem rooted in trust.

## What We Heard and Observed

Health workers told us that referrals often arrive incomplete or unverified, leaving receiving facilities with no way to confirm what care was provided previously. Patients described a different experience, one in which they are sent back and forth between facilities while carrying papers they do not fully understand and fearing that losing a single document could delay or deny care. What repeated itself was not negligence but fragility, expressed through weak paper trails, fragile chains of trust, and stressful experiences for people who are already vulnerable. These experiences and patterns are documented more fully in our [Community Essence Map](./community-essence-map).

## Where the System Breaks

As we mapped the ecosystem, the breakdown became clearer, with health centers relying on paper referrals, hospitals depending on trust in those papers, and patients bearing the responsibility of transporting documents safely across long distances. Because there is no shared system that allows facilities to verify referrals quickly and confidently, multiple points of failure emerge, referrals are questioned, care is delayed, patients repeat tests or are redirected unnecessarily, and trust between institutions weakens. The roles, incentives, and risks across this system are explored further in our [Stakeholder Map](./stakeholder-map).

## Naming the Real Challenge

Initially, we thought the challenge was digitizing referrals, but that was only part of the picture. The deeper issue is that healthcare referrals move across institutions without a reliable way to verify their authenticity, history, or integrity, and when verification is weak care slows down, patients suffer, and in urgent cases delays can become life threatening. This understanding shaped our [Problem Statement](./problem-statement) and shifted the focus from paperwork efficiency toward trust and continuity of care.

## How We Changed

This process changed how we think about healthcare technology by moving our attention away from systems alone and toward patient experience. A referral is not just a document but a promise that care will continue smoothly, and trust in healthcare systems is built quietly through records that are reliable, verifiable, and easy to understand by professionals who are already overloaded. In this context, technology must be lightweight and respectful, supporting coordination without creating new burdens, and our internal shift and design priorities are explored more deeply in our [Team Reflection](./reflection).

## The Direction Forward

This work points toward a healthcare system where referrals are trusted across facilities, health workers can verify information quickly, patients are not punished for missing or damaged papers, and continuity of care is protected through shared truth rather than fragile documents. Any future solution must prioritize patient safety over technical complexity, because in healthcare trust directly shapes who receives care, when it happens, and how it unfolds.
