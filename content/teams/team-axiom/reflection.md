# 🧠 Team Reflection Summary — Team Axiom

We initially approached this problem as a **technical integration challenge**. We focused on how to link systems, verify referrals, and ensure data integrity using blockchain.

After engaging with healthcare workers and patients, our understanding changed.

What stood out was how **small administrative failures create serious human consequences**. A missing stamp or an unverifiable form can delay treatment, force patients to travel again, or completely block access to care. In these moments, technology failure is not abstract—it is deeply personal.

We realized that trust between health facilities is fragile. Without a shared source of truth, each institution protects itself, and patients are caught in the middle.

This pushed us to rethink our role. The problem is not just about building a shared ledger. It is about **reducing friction in moments of vulnerability**.

Our approach shifted toward:
- Lightweight, privacy-preserving referral verification
- Systems that work offline or with intermittent connectivity
- Tools that integrate into existing workflows instead of replacing them

For us, blockchain is not the point. **Care is the point.**  
If technology does not shorten the path between a patient and treatment, it does not belong in the system.

Our guiding belief now is simple:  
**Healthcare technology must earn trust by removing obstacles, not adding new ones.**
