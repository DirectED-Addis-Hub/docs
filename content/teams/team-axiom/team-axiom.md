# 🧭 Community Essence Map — Team Axiom

**Focus area:** Patient referrals and continuity of care between health centers  
**Context:** Urban and peri-urban health facilities in Ethiopia

## Stories from the field

Healthcare workers and patients consistently described the referral process as fragile and stressful.

Patients often arrive at a secondary hospital without proper referral papers. Some papers are lost during travel; others are rejected because they are incomplete or unverifiable. Patients described being sent back and forth between facilities, sometimes multiple times, while their condition worsened.

Healthcare staff shared frustration at having to rely on handwritten forms and stamps that are easy to forge or dispute. When trust breaks down between facilities, patients bear the cost.

## Observations (what keeps repeating)

- Referral papers are physical, fragile, and easily lost.
- Health centers do not trust referral documents from other facilities.
- Patients travel long distances only to be turned away.
- Verification depends on phone calls or personal relationships.
- Delays directly affect patient outcomes and dignity.

## Patterns, tensions, and themes

- **Pattern:** Paper-based referrals as single points of failure
- **Pattern:** Fragmented health records across facilities
- **Tension:** Urgency of care vs. administrative verification
- **Tension:** Patient trust vs. institutional mistrust
- **Theme:** Systemic inefficiency harming vulnerable patients
- **Theme:** Lack of shared truth across the health system

## Typical patient journey

Primary health center → handwritten referral → travel → rejection or delay → return trip → repeated verification → treatment (if lucky)

Each break in the chain increases risk and suffering.
