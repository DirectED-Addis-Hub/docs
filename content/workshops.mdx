# 📘 Workshops

## 🧭 Overview

Workshops are the core learning sessions for the Addis Ababa Hub. They are designed to help teams improve problem framing, documentation quality, and technical execution as they move from exploration to working prototypes.

Each workshop builds on the previous one, and all materials are tied directly to the session recordings for easy reference.

## 📘 Reading Materials

If you are new to Cardano or want a stronger foundation, **start with the Cardano Learning Center**. It is the primary reference we recommend throughout the hackathon.

👉 [**Cardano Learning Center**](https://www.notion.so/Cardano-Learning-Center-2a152c03837981a58d64f286e7b24e84?pvs=21)

*Core learning hub for Cardano concepts, tooling, and ecosystem knowledge.*

Additional optional readings:

- [**Blockchain intro & basics**](https://www.notion.so/e57cbde0818948e39a16ffdc3a4fddd8?pvs=21)
- [**Beyond Bitcoin: Smart Contracts**](https://www.notion.so/b86a9182a3ce40c28fe61e76b33887cd?pvs=21)

You do **not** need to read everything at once; use these resources as references while building.
